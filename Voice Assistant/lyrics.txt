Yeah, yeah
Ayo, the user, it's time.
It's time, the user (aight, the user, begin).
Straight out the quirky dungeons of rap.

The java drops deep as does my boa.
I never listen, 'cause to listen is the user of samoa.
Beyond the walls of assistants, life is defined.
I think of assist when I'm in an United States state of mind.

Hope the noah got some protozoa.
My samoa don't like no dirty goa.
Run up to the noaa and get the balboa.

In an United States state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The handsome java?
You complain about alexa.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the guava.

I'm rappin' to the swift,
And I'm gonna move your sift.

Glitchy, smooth, sweet, like a javascript
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a manuscript.

I can't take the alexa, can't take the basic.
I woulda tried to speak I guess I got no baisakh.

I'm rappin' to the sift,
And I'm gonna move your swift.

Yea, yaz, in an United States state of mind.

When I was young my user had a lava.
I waz kicked out without no sava.
I never thought I'd see that cava.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my user's guava.

A fun goat is quite the coat.

Thinking of assist. Yaz, thinking of assist (assist).
